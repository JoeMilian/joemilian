<h1 id="response-targets">Response Targets</h1>

<p>The following represent best efforts response targets for hackers participating in this program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time to first response (from report submit) - 15 business days</li>
<li>Time to triage (from report submit) - 20 business days</li>
<li>Time to bounty (from triage) - 10 business days</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.</p>

<h1 id="program-rules">Program Rules</h1>

<ul>
<li>Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reports out of scope will not be considered.</strong> Please check before submitting.</li>
<li>Note that Celo is an open source project.</li>
<li>Submit one vulnerability per-report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.</li>
<li>When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).</li>
<li>Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.</li>
<li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the account holder.</li>
<li>Attacking any testnet other than the official Celo Baklava testnet (“Network”) is prohibited.</li>
<li>Any attacks that could cause physical damage or incur costs to other’s property  is prohibited.</li>

<h1 id="test-plan">Test Plan</h1>

<ul>
<li>Set up a node on the network following these instructions: <a href="https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-full-node" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span>Getting Started - Running a Full Node</span><i class="icon-external-link"></i></a>.</li>
